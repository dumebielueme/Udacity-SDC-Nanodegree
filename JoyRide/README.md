JoyRide was the first project in Udacity's Intro to Self Driving Cars.

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook <a href="https://github.com/dumebielueme/Udacity-SDC-Nanodegree/blob/master/JoyRide/ParallelParking.ipynb"> ParallelParking.ipynb</a> with short code used to control the call and park it. It also contains the video showing the control, also available on <a href="https://youtu.be/GXum4dYZY8M"> Youtube</a>.
